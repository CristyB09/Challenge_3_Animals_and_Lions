     # Challenge_3_Animals_and_Lions


     The Lion sub-class
     1. In your Animal project develop a sub-class of Animal called Lion.
     a. Provide the sub-class with an integer class variable to count the number of
     Lion objects created.
     b. The sub-class should also have two instance variables
     age e.g. 3, 5
    name e.g. “Leo”, “Simba”
    c. It should also have the following constructor methods:
    • A default constructor method
    • A constructor method which accepts four parameters (two to
    initialise the inherited properties food and lifeExpectancy, and
    two to initialise the Lion instance variables age and name).
    2. Write a method called setAge() which accepts an integer as a parameter and sets
    the age instance variable to this value.
    3. Write a toString() method for the Lion class to return an appropriate message
    indicating the age, food it eats and whether or not it has a mane – make use of the
    toString() method in the Animal class.
    4. Write a method called numberOfLions() to return the number of Lion objects
    created.
    The TestAnimal Application class
    5. Write an application class called TestAnimal that will create two Lion objects
    called myLion1 and myLion2. Initialise the properties required with values of
    your own choice.
    6. Make a call to an appropriate method to set the age of MyLion1 to 3.
    7. Print out the details of myLion1 using the toString() method and the number
    of Lions created using the numberOfLions() method.
